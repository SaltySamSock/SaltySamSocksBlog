Why does it seem people are intrinsically manipulative, even though manipulative behavior is a learned trait or coping method? It seems people subconsciously are manipulative, growing to be manipulative in ways they do not realize — such as feeling they are owed something from another party. This comes naturally in the modern day, and I'm not sure why.  

It seems every other person feels obligated to have an explanation for another party's actions, without realizing that you don't have to explain anything to anybody but yourself.

One's explanation is a gift, a gift to that party to sway them from their natural instinctive thoughts of that person's actions, for it is to cover their own trail — one where you would assume the worst of that party. In other words, the only reason someone would want to explain their actions is to convince you that they are not in the wrong — or that they are.  

But for some reason, we've become so accustomed to people explaining their actions that we feel owed an explanation — that we cannot come up with our own idea of why someone has done something without asking — and we feel offended when another party declines to explain their actions, despite not being owed an explanation in the first place.  

Why do people seem to be more manipulative nowadays? Is it just me realizing it, or has this current environment that we live in catered to manipulative behavior?  

Modern people feel that, due to a friendship, they are owed something. People take the phrase “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,” expecting it to be reciprocated. People give only to receive in this transactional society we live in. People no longer give to others just for the sake of giving and helping; they do it for the superficial title or the congratulations they are given. They are not selfless — and if they are selfless, they are selfishly selfless.  

Why, in modern times, do people feel it is their obligation to prescribe their ideal way of living — their idealistic manifestos, or their pillars of civilization — that they force upon others, believing those who do not follow it are sacrilegious? I believe that if one does not follow the prescribed moral code that you have set in stone for them, then they are as good as dead.  

How do we feel offended when somebody keeps to themselves? It's not as if these people are bad people. These people do caring things. They help others. They want to be loved, and they want to give love as they do to other people. But it's with this subconscious manipulative way that they go about it — where they feel entitled to this love for giving attention, or expect one to die in battle for them because they bought them coffee.  

Why are people so intrinsically good at realizing these manipulative behaviors — behaviors that are studied and used — that you’ll often see in nature? People use the foot-in-the-door method without realizing it. They will ask you for a favor, and then they will pile on more and more. Once you agree to that first “sure,” they do not mean to do it intentionally — but that’s how the door-to-door salesman gets their sale.  

It may be due to a lack of introspection, or a lack of reflection at all. Why would one want to reflect on their own actions if they get what they want?  

It pains me to ponder how one can be offended when one is being manipulative, expecting the other party to adhere to demands spoken in a snake’s tongue.  

If I were to cut off all my hair tomorrow and you asked me why, and I replied, “I do not wish to share,” why would you feel personally attacked? Is it out of inadequacy — feeling that you are not worthy of hearing my answer or my explanation, that you are not close enough of a friend? Would you feel it is obligatory for me to explain to you due to our friendship? Or would you understand that one man's mind is his own?
