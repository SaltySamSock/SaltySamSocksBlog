# Malignant Connection


In the current time we live in, that being as I write this, 2025, we are currently in a malignant state of social interaction, which has been caused by an ease of connection of shallow depth — that being easier internet relations of pseudo-anonymous invocation. Individuals partake in conversations that don’t break the surface of the water. These conversations being of interpersonal provocation events or disputes.

Many people hold a relationship as long as it is agreeable. As in, when a friend falls into fault, they are absent in their times of need and/or rude. This breeds relations of fleeting longevity and faltering connection. In times of old, others would connect over similarities and/or discuss differences such as hockey teams or different career paths.

Nowadays, the similarities are fake — a colloquial in-joke. This being different memes and/or media that is readily available to everyone. But the exchange of knowledge of these already-known-by-both-parties facts provides a connection and/or comfort based on someone you know nothing about. You feel more comfortable in the presence of this person due to them knowing a similar thing is you. This breeds relationships that pertain nothing of personal value.

Whereas these relations only reside in discussion of favorable medium, we, as a society — that being a North American society that I reside in — are currently working towards a convergence of different demographics in ways of conversation. Whereas authoritative and/or emotional conversations are diverging from different gender roles of old and different demographics. Studies have shown that there is a merger of these conversations where there is a lacking of connective speech as well as a lacking of authoritative speech.

When was the last time you had an authoritative conversation? Not one of someone bossing you around, but one where there are clear authoritative roles between each other — not one of disrespect, but one bonded out of respect, such as one with a parental figure. When was the last time you had a conversation that was devoid of interpersonal goals and/or of one’s history, rather than what is being done and/or going to be done?

When was the last time you felt like you really knew someone? In current times, you’ll have others that just utter these momentary phrases as an impulse, uncomfortable in silence. This silence is terrifying to the end user. They would rather fill it up with this faux colloquial nonsense than ponder a powerful thought.

In the current age, everybody wants to be an individual, but we walk around mimicking each other as if we were a hive mind — a hive communicating in pheromonal triggers rather than as an intellectual species with individual thoughts. It seems that the more we swing towards individuality, the more we become the same, as we all belong to the same human species.

Rather than seeking individuality, you should seek real connection — one that shares discourse but also has genuine relatability, one where you understand that the other person is human just as you are. These relationships may have faults, but it’s the way they are dealt with that makes them more tenacious.
A relationship where you can argue with this person, have disagreement, and then still eat dinner or lunch the same day together. One where you can have disagreements, shake hands upon it, or agree to disagree. These relationships have longevity, and they do not grow farther apart due to their differences but together, and they become stronger. These are the relationships that are a dying breed in modern times.
